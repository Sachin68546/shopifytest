    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
       <strong>Last updated:</strong> July 10, 2024</p>

    <p>Profit First Analytics (“we”, “us” or “our”) respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about how your information is collected, used, and shared is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information you provide through our Profit First Analytics dashboard and related services (the “Service”). If not otherwise defined here, capitalized terms have the meanings given in our Terms & Conditions.</p>

    <h2>1. What Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you connect your Shopify store (and any future e-commerce platforms, collectively “Platform(s)”), and third-party services like Facebook Ads and Google Ads, we access certain data, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Store Properties</strong> – settings, metadata, currency.</li>
      <li><strong>Products</strong> – product catalog, variants, inventory.</li>
      <li><strong>Orders & Transactions</strong> – order history, payments.</li>
      <li><strong>Customers</strong> – customer profiles (you may request removal at any time).</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing Data</strong> – statistics from Facebook Marketing API, Google Ads API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also collect “Personal Information” you provide directly, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, email address, and phone number</li>
      <li>Profile info when you sign in via Google or Facebook</li>
      <li>Any other information you send us (e.g. support inquiries)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And we automatically log technical details (IP address, browser, device) to help secure and improve the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and personalize the Service (dashboards, reports, alerts)</li>
      <li>Authenticate and support your account</li>
      <li>Communicate updates, offers, and support messages (you may opt-out of promotional emails)</li>
      <li>Analyze trends and compile aggregated “Statistical Information” (never tied to individuals)</li>
      <li>Share anonymized insights with partners to enable tailored business offers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will not sell your Personal Information. Any sharing with trusted partners is solely to fulfill the Service or with your explicit consent.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Protect Information</h2>
    <p>We follow industry standards—including encryption in transit and at rest—to safeguard your data. However, no system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
    <p>You may request deletion of your Personal Information at any time; please email privacy@profitfirstanalytics.com.</p>

    <h2>4. For EU & UK Residents</h2>
    <p>If you reside in the EEA or UK, you have additional rights under GDPR, including access, correction, and deletion of your data.

Your data may be transferred outside the EEA/UK (e.g. to our servers in the U.S.) under standard safeguards.</p>

    <h2>5. Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may link to third-party sites. We are not responsible for their privacy practices; please review their policies separately.</p>

    <p>The Service is intended for users aged 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 13. If you believe a minor has provided us data, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>7. Correcting or Updating Your Information</h2>
    <p>You can view and update your account details at any time. To request changes or deletion, email support@profitfirstanalytics.com.</p>

    <h2>8. Limited Use Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Any data obtained via Google APIs will be handled in accordance with Google’s User Data Policy and Limited Use requirements.</p>

    <h2>9. Communications</h2>
